# Let's Go!

This project is an initial attempt to work with the Go language. I'll track some process and include
documentation here.

## History

### Go Docs

I began this effort by visiting the Go documentation here: https://go.dev/doc/articles/wiki/

While the doc is informative, the project wasn't exactly something I wanted to tackle. I didn't
really want to create/edit/delete and serve pages of content. I'm looking more for an API tutorial.

### VS Code Dev Container

Then, I thought I'd try to experiment with a VS Code Dev Container:
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-go

I went this route because I know from experience that dev containers are an easy way to spin up new
projects with dependencies in Docker, without needing to install them directly on my machine.

### Setting up Let's Go

From the VS Code Dev Container, I decided to pick a few key files and copy them into a new
repository. This would serve as my boilerplate.
